HTML to docx
------------

Meteor package for creating `.docx` files on the client from html.

#### Quick start

`meteor add babrahams:html2docx`

To create a link that triggers the download of a specified element as a `.docx` file:

`{{> html2docx selector="#target-element"}}`

with

`<div id="target-element"><strong>HTML</strong> to be turned into a docx file</div>`

(the `selector` parameter is required)

#### Options

When initiating the widget, use these parameters to configure it:

`linkText="Download"` changes the text of the link (default is "Download as Word document")

`linkClass="my-class-for-links"` puts a custom class attribute on the link (users of Bootstrap might use `btn` here)

`linkStyle="text-decoration: none;"` puts a custom style attribute on the link

`linkTitle="Download as Word document"` puts a title attribute on the link

`css="h1 { color: red; }"` adds a custom set of css rules to the `.docx` file that is generated

`filename="my_word_doc"` changes the name of the downloaded file (default is "export")

`includeStylesheets=false` means there will be no attempt to include css from the application's stylesheets (default is `true`)

`useDocNotDocx=true` produces `.doc` file instead of a `.docx` file (added because Word 2016 won't open html files with extension changed to `.docx` but it will open `.doc` files made this way)

#### Warning

This is not going to work in all browsers.  See [this post](http://www.effectiveui.com/blog/2015/02/23/generating-a-downloadable-word-document-in-the-browser/) (from which inspiration for this package was drawn), and note that this package only uses the `download` attribute of the `<a>` tag. This will probably only work with recent versions of Chrome and Firefox.

Application styles will not appear in the `.docx` file as they appear in the app. To quote from the post above:

"Word supports a small, outdated subset of CSS. Properties such as `background-color`, `color`, `font-size`, `font-weight`, `text-align`, `margin`, and `padding` are supported. CSS3 selectors, as well as properties like float and position donâ€™t work. You can give elements `class` and `id` attributes to target with a stylesheet."
