CHANGELOG
=========

### vNext

- There probably won't be one -- this is a quick-and-dirty solution to a very complex problem

### v0.2.0

- Can produce .doc files so they can be opened with Word 2016 (ironically)

### v0.1.x

- Just produced .docx files
- Doesn't work on some browsers (Safari. IE.) -- only works on FF and Chrome
